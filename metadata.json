    "description": "Game Chart Token is the core of a gaming project blending Japanese mythology with GameFi. The token is used for staking (letting holders earn rewards and deepen their engagement), governance (providing voting rights on the project’s development), and fueling the in-game economy (enabling the purchase of exclusive NFTs and items). This tangible utility embodies the spirit of the Oni—guardians of luck and daring in Japanese folklore.",
